# Leetcode solutions in Rust

Solutions to leetcode problems in the Rust programming language! Each problem
is in its own file, named using the pattern `<problem number>_<problem description>.rs`.

When solving a problem, start by copying `template.rs`, and then pasting in the
starting code from leetcode. Create test cases and then run them using:

```
./test.sh file_to_test.rs
```

`test.sh` requires the nix package manager and `rustc` to be installed.
